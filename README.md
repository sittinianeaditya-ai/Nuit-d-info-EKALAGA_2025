As part of **Night of Information 2025**, we developed a fun web platform to raise awareness among schools about **Inclusive, Responsible, and Sustainable (NIRD)** digital technology.

## General Site Concept

The site takes the form of an **interactive adventure** in several chapters, presented as a *storyline* where the user explores a "sick" school filled with slow and underoptimized PCs.

The goal is to transform this outdated school, dependent on Big Tech, into a **NIRD** school by making the right digital choices along the way.

The main character, **Nirdy**, serves as a guide throughout the story and accompanies the user in their decisions.

## Chapter-Based Path

The selection page offers 5 chapters, each corresponding to a specific situation:

- **Chapter 1 – The School of Tomorrow**: functional computers but "too old" for Windows 11 due to the lack of TPM.

- **Chapter 2 – The Computers Are Slowing Down**: teachers complain that the machines take 10 minutes to boot up.

- **Chapter 3 – Trip to the Library**: For the library, the main need is for web browsing and word processing on aging PCs.

- **Chapter 4 – Destination: The Basement**: Discovery of 12-year-old PCs stored in the basement, with the question, “Trash or Reuse?”

- **Chapter 5 – Across the Continent**: Reflection on European digital sovereignty and the use of local solutions versus American services.

Each chapter begins with a **short story** that contextualizes the hardware, software, or geopolitical problem.

## Game Mechanics and Quizzes

At the end of each story, the user must answer a **multiple-choice questionnaire** (usually two options).

The questions contrasted, for example:

- “Throw everything away and buy new” vs. “Install a lightweight operating system based on Linux.”

- “Continue using only American services” vs. “Invest in European technological solutions.”

Educational tooltips explain the impact of the choices, including: the hardware is often still good, it's the software that's the limiting factor, and switching to Linux can extend the lifespan of the machines.

The user's answers are stored and then used to calculate an overall NIRD transition score.

## Conclusion Page

The **conclusion** page displays a “summary of your journey” that indicates whether the institution has successfully completed its NIRD transition based on the answers provided.

If all questions have not been answered, a message indicates that the journey is incomplete and that the score cannot be calculated, with a link to return to the beginning.

This gamified approach provides clear feedback on the impact of the user's decisions, in line with the NIRD objectives.

## NIRD Messages Promoted by the Site

The site highlights several **key principles** of responsible digital practices:

- **Digital Sobriety**: avoid systematically replacing hardware when a software solution (lightweight Linux, optimization) can extend its lifespan.

- **Reuse and Repurposing**: give value to old PCs (library, basement, machines without TPM) rather than sending them directly to the landfill.

- **Digital Sovereignty**: encourage the use of European solutions and digital commons to reduce dependence on major American platforms.

The platform aims to be a **NIRD Starter Kit** for schools, raising user awareness in a fun and interactive way.

## Easter Eggs and Retro Mode

To enhance the fun aspect, several **easter eggs** have been integrated:

- A **retro mode** is hidden on the first history page: it is activated by typing "retro" and changes the visual style to evoke older interfaces.

- A **Snake game** is hidden on the homepage:

- First mentioned in very small text.

- Then even more discreetly in the footer.

- Finally, reduced to a simple clickable "dead pixel" to launch the game.

These elements reward users' curiosity while echoing the theme of old PCs and vintage interfaces.

## About Us Page and Team

The **About Us** page presents the project's context (Nuit de l’Info 2025, Computer Science Department, IUT de Paris – Rives de Seine) and the team's composition.

It reiterates the main mission: to provide an **educational tool** enabling schools to initiate or support a digital inclusion and resource development (NIRD) approach, with more eco-responsible, inclusive, and accessible digital technology.
